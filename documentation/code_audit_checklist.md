# WordPress Theme Code Audit Checklist

## 1. Project Overview
- [ ] Analyze project structure, architecture, and dependencies
- [ ] Identify primary languages (PHP, JavaScript, CSS) and frameworks (WordPress, jQuery, Chart.js)
- [ ] Review WordPress coding standards and best practices adherence
- [ ] Check theme hierarchy and template file organization

## 2. Proactive Code Review
- [ ] Examine each file systematically (PHP, JS, CSS)
- [ ] Apply static code analysis for PHP (e.g., PHP_CodeSniffer)
- [ ] Use JSHint or ESLint for JavaScript analysis
- [ ] Check for WordPress-specific issues (e.g., nonce usage, capability checks)
- [ ] Identify potential security vulnerabilities (SQL injection, XSS)
- [ ] Assess code complexity and candidates for refactoring
- [ ] Review proper usage of WordPress hooks and filters

## 3. Function Analysis
- [ ] Evaluate functions for correctness, efficiency, and WordPress compatibility
- [ ] Identify any broken or partially implemented functions
- [ ] Check for proper sanitization and escaping of data
- [ ] Analyze function interfaces and WordPress action/filter usage
- [ ] Ensure proper error handling and logging
- [ ] Verify correct usage of WordPress global variables and functions

## 4. Performance Optimization
- [ ] Identify performance bottlenecks in PHP and JavaScript code
- [ ] Review database queries for optimization opportunities
- [ ] Analyze asset loading and suggest enqueuing optimizations
- [ ] Consider caching strategies (transients, object caching)
- [ ] Optimize image usage and implement lazy loading
- [ ] Review AJAX implementation for efficiency

## 5. Code Quality Enhancement
- [ ] Assess code readability and adherence to WordPress coding standards
- [ ] Suggest improvements in naming conventions (WordPress-specific)
- [ ] Review inline documentation and PHPDoc usage
- [ ] Identify opportunities to apply WordPress design patterns
- [ ] Check for proper internationalization and localization
- [ ] Ensure accessibility standards are met (WCAG compliance)

## 6. Testing and Validation
- [ ] Review existing test coverage (if any)
- [ ] Propose unit tests for critical theme functions
- [ ] Recommend integration tests for WordPress-specific functionality
- [ ] Suggest end-to-end tests for user interactions
- [ ] Verify cross-browser and responsive design testing
- [ ] Ensure compatibility with latest WordPress version

## 7. WordPress-Specific Checks
- [ ] Verify proper theme file structure (style.css, functions.php, etc.)
- [ ] Check for correct usage of template tags
- [ ] Review custom post type and taxonomy implementations
- [ ] Analyze widget and sidebar implementations
- [ ] Verify proper enqueueing of scripts and styles
- [ ] Check for theme option and customizer implementation best practices

## 8. Security Audit
- [ ] Verify proper nonce usage in forms and AJAX calls
- [ ] Check for correct capability checks before performing actions
- [ ] Review data sanitization and escaping practices
- [ ] Analyze potential vulnerabilities in third-party libraries
- [ ] Check for secure communication (HTTPS) enforcement
- [ ] Review file permissions and sensitive data handling

## 9. Reporting and Documentation
- [ ] Prioritize identified issues based on severity and impact
- [ ] Provide clear, actionable recommendations for each issue
- [ ] Document analysis process and reasoning for optimizations
- [ ] Create a changelog for suggested updates
- [ ] Prepare user documentation for any new features or changes

## 10. Continuous Improvement
- [ ] Suggest tools for ongoing code quality maintenance (e.g., PHPCS, WPCS)
- [ ] Recommend version control best practices (e.g., Git workflow)
- [ ] Propose a code review process for future development
- [ ] Suggest automated testing implementation (e.g., PHPUnit, WP-CLI)
- [ ] Recommend regular security audit schedule
- [ ] Propose a plan for keeping the theme updated with WordPress core changes
