File: js/custom-scripts.js

1. Overall Structure:
   - The code is wrapped in a jQuery document ready function, which is good practice.
   - Use of const for variables that don't change is appropriate.
   - Good use of ES6 features like arrow functions and destructuring.

2. Variable Declarations:
   Lines 2-7:
   - Good use of destructuring to extract values from the athleteDashboard object.
   - Appropriate use of let for variables that might be reassigned.

3. Function Definitions:
   - Functions are well-organized and follow a logical flow.
   - Good separation of concerns with different functions for different tasks.

Issues and Suggestions:

1. jQuery Dependency:
   The script heavily relies on jQuery.
   Suggestion: Consider gradually moving towards vanilla JavaScript for better performance.
   Priority: Medium

2. Error Handling:
   Many AJAX calls lack proper error handling.
   Suggestion: Add .fail() handlers to AJAX calls or use try/catch blocks with async/await.
   Priority: High

3. Code Duplication:
   There's some repetition in AJAX calls and chart initialization.
   Suggestion: Create utility functions for common AJAX operations and chart initialization.
   Priority: Medium

4. Performance:
   Line 580: setInterval for updating progress chart every 5 minutes might be unnecessary.
   Suggestion: Consider updating only when the user interacts or use a push mechanism instead.
   Priority: Low

5. Security:
   Ensure all AJAX calls are using nonces correctly (which seems to be the case, but double-check).
   Priority: High

6. Accessibility:
   Some dynamic content changes might need ARIA live regions.
   Suggestion: Add appropriate ARIA attributes for dynamically updated content.
   Priority: Medium

7. Browser Compatibility:
   Usage of modern JavaScript features might not work in older browsers.
   Suggestion: Consider using Babel for transpiling if supporting older browsers is necessary.
   Priority: Low

   - Charts are initialized but not checked if the elements exist.
   Suggestion: Add null checks before initializing charts.
   Priority: Medium

2. Local Storage Usage:
   Lines 49-51:
   - Local storage is used without checking for support.
   Suggestion: Add a check for local storage support before using it.
   Priority: Low

3. jQuery UI Tabs:
   Lines 7-22:
   - Usage of jQuery UI might be overkill for simple tabs.
   Suggestion: Consider implementing tabs with vanilla JS or a lighter library.
   Priority: Low

4. Form Submissions:
   Lines 414-453, 457-480:
   - Form submissions could benefit from more robust validation.
   Suggestion: Implement client-side validation before AJAX submission.
   Priority: Medium

5. Date Handling:
   Various places in the code:
   - Dates are handled as strings, which can be error-prone.
   Suggestion: Consider using a date library like date-fns for more robust date handling.
   Priority: Low

Summary:

The custom-scripts.js file is well-structured and makes good use of modern JavaScript features. It handles various functionalities of the Athlete Dashboard effectively. However, there are several areas where improvements can be made to enhance performance, maintainability, and user experience.

Key points for improvement:
1. Enhance error handling in AJAX calls.
2. Reduce jQuery dependency where possible.
3. Improve code organization and reduce duplication.
